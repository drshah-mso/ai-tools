# PRISMA-P

{% embed url="http://prisma-statement.org/Extensions/Protocols?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1" %}

**PRISMA-P**, or Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols, is a guideline specifically designed to enhance the transparency and quality of systematic review protocols. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are crucial methods in evidence-based research, and PRISMA-P aims to ensure that the protocols for conducting these reviews are well-designed, transparent, and reproducible.

An overview of PRISMA-P and its key components:

**Importance of Systematic Review Protocols:** A systematic review protocol outlines the planned methods and procedures for conducting a systematic review or meta-analysis. It acts as a roadmap for researchers, ensuring that the review is conducted in a systematic and unbiased manner. Clear and well-documented protocols also reduce the risk of bias and increase the reliability of the review's findings.

**Key Components of PRISMA-P:** PRISMA-P provides a structured framework for reporting systematic review protocols, helping researchers and readers understand the methodology and rationale behind the planned review. The guideline covers the following key components:

1. **Title and Registration:** PRISMA-P encourages authors to provide a clear and informative title for their protocol. It also recommends registering the protocol in a publicly accessible database to enhance transparency.
2. **Rationale:** Authors should outline the research question or objective of the review and provide a justification for conducting it. This includes explaining the relevance and potential impact of the review.
3. **Objectives:** Clearly state the primary and secondary objectives of the review, specifying the outcomes of interest and any planned subgroup analyses.
4. **Eligibility Criteria:** Describe the criteria for including or excluding studies in the review. This includes defining the population, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study designs (PICOS).
5. **Information Sources:** Specify the databases, search engines, and other sources that will be used to search for relevant studies. This ensures transparency in the search strategy.
6. **Search Strategy:** Provide a detailed description of the planned search strategy, including search terms, Boolean operators, and any limits or filters applied.
7. **Study Selection:** Outline the process for screening and selecting studies, including the number of reviewers involved and the criteria for reaching consensus.
8. **Data Extraction:** Describe the data extraction process, including the information to be extracted from each study, methods for dealing with missing data, and strategies for managing data discrepancies.
9. **Risk of Bias Assessment:** Explain how the risk of bias in included studies will be assessed. Specify the tools or criteria that will be used.
10. **Data Synthesis:** Describe the planned methods for analyzing and synthesizing data, including statistical techniques, subgroup analyses, and meta-analysis (if applicable).
11. **Confidence in Cumulative Evidence:** Discuss how the certainty or quality of the evidence will be assessed using tools like GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).
12. **Additional Analyses:** Outline any additional analyses, such as sensitivity analyses, publication bias assessments, or exploratory analyses.
13. **Funding:** Disclose any sources of funding for the review.

**Benefits of PRISMA-P:** Adhering to PRISMA-P when writing and reporting systematic review protocols offers several benefits:

* **Transparency:** PRISMA-P promotes transparency by ensuring that researchers provide detailed information about their planned methods and procedures.
* **Reproducibility:** Well-documented protocols increase the likelihood that others can replicate the review process.
* **Reduced Bias:** Clear reporting of eligibility criteria, search strategies, and data extraction methods minimizes the risk of bias in the review process.
* **Enhanced Quality:** Following PRISMA-P guidelines helps authors design a comprehensive and rigorous review protocol.
* **Improved Peer Review:** Journal editors and peer reviewers can use PRISMA-P to assess the quality and completeness of systematic review protocols submitted for publication.
