# SRDR+ (AHRQ)

{% embed url="https://srdrplus.ahrq.gov/" %}

SRDR+ is a free, powerful, easy to use tool for data extraction, management, and archival during systematic reviews.

In an effort to reduce the burden of conducting systematic reviews, researchers and developers at the Brown University Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) (previously at Tufts Medical Center), with support from the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) ](https://www.ahrq.gov/) developed a collaborative, Web-based repository of systematic review data. This resource serves as both an archive and data extraction tool and is shared among organizations and individuals producing systematic reviews worldwide, enabling the creation of a central database of systematic review data which may be critiqued, updated, and augmented on an ongoing basis. This database is freely accessible to facilitate evidence reviews and thus improve and speed up policy-making with regards to healthcare.

SRDR+ is an updated version of SRDR with a range of new features and improvements to the system. For a period of time, both SRDR and SRDR+ will run in parallel. We will send out notifications so that you are prepared for the eventual migration of all projects from SRDR to SRDR+.

## Why have an open systematic review data repository?

Such a repository helps the world in various ways, such as through:

* Improved access to data by consumers of systematic review evidence;
* Promotion of transparency and reliability in the systematic review process via communal review;
* Enhanced cooperation and utilization across related resources (such as [ClinicalTrials.gov ](https://clinicaltrials.gov/));
* More efficient means of producing and updating systematic reviews; and
* Facilitation of other novel avenues of inquiry, such as those investigating research methodology (e.g., comparing different types of outcomes across disciplines, or comparing methodological quality of studies based on funding sources) by concentrating relevant data into one readily available resource.
