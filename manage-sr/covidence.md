Covidence is an online software tool designed to streamline the process of conducting a systematic review (or a similarly detailed literature review such as a meta-analysis). It is currently free. You can use Covidence to collaborate with a team of reviewers to screen results (at both title/abstract and full text stages), complete data extraction and work on risk of bias. It is owned and operated by Evidence Partners. Covidence can be used to:

* **Plan a systematic review:** Covidence can be used to plan a systematic review by creating a protocol, identifying relevant studies, and collecting data from those studies.
* **Screen studies:** Covidence can be used to screen studies for eligibility in a systematic review. This can be done by using filters to identify studies that meet the inclusion criteria.
* **Extract data:** Covidence can be used to extract data from studies that have been included in a systematic review. This data can then be used to conduct a meta-analysis.
* **Manage references:** Covidence can be used to manage references for a systematic review. This includes creating a reference list, tracking citations, and generating bibliographies.
* **Collaborate:** Covidence can be used to collaborate with others on a systematic review. This can be done by creating shared workspaces and assigning tasks to team members.
