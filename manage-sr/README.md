# Managing a Systematic Review

Sure. Managing a systematic review is a complex process that requires careful planning and execution. There are a number of tools available to help researchers manage their systematic reviews, including:

* **PRISMA-P:** The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P) is a checklist that can be used to plan and report a systematic review. The checklist includes 27 items that cover all aspects of a systematic review, from the research question to the data analysis.
* **EQUATOR Network:** The EQUATOR Network is a collaboration of organizations that promote the accurate and transparent reporting of research. The network has developed a number of guidelines for reporting systematic reviews, including the **EQUATOR Guidelines for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses**.
* **Review Manager (RevMan):** RevMan is a software application that can be used to manage systematic reviews. RevMan allows researchers to import and export citations, create bibliographies, and conduct meta-analyses.
* **Covidence:** Covidence is a web-based platform that can be used to manage systematic reviews. Covidence allows researchers to collaborate with others on research projects, track the progress of their reviews, and store their data securely.
