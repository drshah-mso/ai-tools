## What is Colandr?&#x20;

Colandr is a free, web-based, open-access tool for conducting evidence synthesis projects, such as systematic and scoping reviews. It is not domain specific; that is, it can be used for all different subject areas. Colandr can be used collaboratively with teams of any size. This tool can also be used throughout multiple stages of the systematic review process: protocol development, citation deduplication, article screening, data extraction and coding, and manuscript development. Data from Colandr can be downloaded into a CSV file and can be used to create tables.
