# The Systematic Review Toolbox

{% embed url="http://systematicreviewtools.com/" %}

The Systematic Review Toolbox is an online catalogue of tools that support various tasks within the systematic review and wider evidence synthesis process. It was developed and founded by [Dr Christopher Marshall](https://twitter.com/drcokefloat) and [Anthea Sutton](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/people/staff/anthea-sutton), launching in 2014.

In 2022, the Systematic Review Toolbox underwent a significant update. This included:

* New categorisation of guidance and software tools in accordance with the systematic review taxonomy presented in [Sutton _et al._ 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hir.12276).
* Updating the records to reflect what stage of the review processs tools aim to address.
* Checking each record to assess when the tool was last updated, or when the most recent related publication was published.
* Checking individual records and links to ensure all tools are currently active and available.
* Developing a modern website with improved accessibility.

The Toolbox is developed, edited and maintained by a small team of researchers spanning the Review and Information Services team at York Health Economics Consoritum (University of York), the Evidence Synthesis Group at Newcastle University/NIHR Innovation Observatory, and the School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield.
