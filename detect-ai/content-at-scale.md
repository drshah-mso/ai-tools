Content at Scale boasts extensive training on an enormous dataset comprising billions of pages, allowing it to predict the most likely word selections with a high degree of accuracy.

As one of the leading AI plagiarism detection tools, it sets itself apart by leveraging a proprietary content generator that taps into multiple layers of AI components. With this sophisticated approach, Content at Scale can analyze various forms of AI, including ChatGPT, to detect instances of plagiarized content.

## How Does the Content at Scale AI Checker Work?

Our AI checker at Content at Scale has been trained on billions of pages of data, and can accurately forecast the most probable word choices that lead to a higher AI probability.

Most free AI detectors and AI classifiers are outdated and scan for old language generators, but ours checks for all versions of GPT, including GPT-4. Our proprietary content generator itself taps into multiple layers with three AI components, NLP, semantic analysis algorithms, and SERP parsing capabilities.

Ever since ChatGPT and GPT-3 came on the scene, AI-generated text has almost become a ‘new norm’ in our society.

That’s why we created this AI checker, one of the only tools on the market deeply trained to accurately forecast word strings and text created by ChatGPT and other AI generators.

As AI technology evolves, and ChatGPT gets better and better with the rollout of GPT4, we’re remaining ahead of the game. Created by an entrepreneur with over 15 years experience in SEO and content marketing Justin McGill, our [turnkey content creation tool](https://contentatscale.ai/) helps marketers and agencies generate long-form, 2,500-word blogs in minutes and get 5-10x their time and money back, finally making the content production process painless and easy.

Before we built our own tool or even our own AI content detection tool, we were long-form writers; so we know how much work goes into this process.

Along this journey, it made sense for us to develop an AI detection model for our audience and clientele to use free of charge. Our AI checker tool rivals the best AI classifier, can analyze and find content generated by ChatGPT, or any generative AI model or even an AI rewriter.
