We are a group of insignificant researchers (in the shadow of ChatGPT) hoping to do some significant work for the community. The team for this projects consists of PhD students and engineers from 6 universities/companies.

To recognise text generated by ChatGPT, SimpleAI offers three different versions of the ChatGPT Detector. Version with QA verifies that ChatGPT created the questions and responses. On the backend, a PLM-based classifier is used. Version with basic text validation For PLM-based classifiers to recognise ChatGPT text, they needed a large amount of text. Language version check identifies ChatGPT using language signals.
