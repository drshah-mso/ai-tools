# Open AI Text Classifier

{% embed url="https://gpt3demo.com/apps/openai-ai-text-classifier" %}

The AI Text Classifier is a free tool that predicts how likely it is that a piece of text was generated by AI. The classifier is a fine-tuned GPT model that requires a minimum of 1,000 characters, and is trained on English content written by adults. It is intended to spark discussions on AI literacy, and is not always accurate. Users can submit their text to the classifier to get a result that is either very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely AI-generated.

“Our classifier is not fully reliable. In our evaluations on a “challenge set” of English texts, our classifier correctly identifies 26% of AI-written text (true positives) as “likely AI-written,” while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time (false positives). Our classifier’s reliability typically improves as the length of the input text increases.”
