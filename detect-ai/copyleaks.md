## Overview

Verify what content was written by a human or an AI chatbot with the AI Content Detector Chrome extension from Copyleaks.

With the Copyleaks AI Content Detector, you can quickly and accurately determine what was written by a human and what was created by an AI, including GPT-4 and Bard, even if the AI text was paraphrased or interspersed with human-written content.

Browse with confidence and verify the authenticity of posts on social media, news articles, and even reviews on your favorite shopping sites. The possibilities are endless.
