### What is RefWorks?&#x20;

RefWorks is an online citation manager that helps you keep track of your references, organize them into a bibliography, and cite them properly according to the citation style that you need (e.g. MLA, APA, or Chicago).&#x20;

RefWorks, founded in 2001, provides web-based research management service for corporate, academic, and government organizations. Currently, RefWorks is used by over 900 organizations globally. It supports hundreds of databases. In addition, RefWorks collaborates with providers such as ProQuest, HighWire, EBSCO, ISI, and BioOne.

This [online based service](http://proquest.libguides.com/newrefworks) allows users to create collections of citations. It is easy to add citations to RefWorks from various databases, such as library catalogues. In addition, bibliographic files from EndNote and Zotero can easily be added to RefWorks. The service has peer-sharing capabilities, allowing you to share bibliographic files with others that can be worked on by a group. Citations stored in RefWorks can be added to your documents in any citation format, such as MLA or APA.

### Key Features and Uses

The Write-n-Cite plugin needs to be installed in order to create bibliographies in Google Docs and MS Word. Compared to EndNote, RefWorks has a simpler interface and is easier to learn. Unlike other [citation management systems](https://www.enago.com/academy/organizing-your-research-which-citation-management-tool-to-choose/), it can be purchased by institutions and made available to the students for free. Other systems need to be purchased individually by users. In addition, bibliographies can be formatted in MS Word and Google Docs via the Write-n-Cite plugin.

RefWorks is unable to retrieve full-text versions of journal articles, unlike EndNote. It does not have the capability to create a formatted list of charts and figures and does not work on mobile devices. It can be used with iPads, but functionality is limited. Nevertheless, it can be used to store and annotate PDFs.
