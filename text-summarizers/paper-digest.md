# Paper Digest

{% embed url="https://www.paper-digest.com/" %}

Paper Digest uses an AI to generate an automatic summary of a given research paper. You can simply provide a [_DOI (digital object identifier)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital\_object\_identifier), or the url to a _PDF_ file, then Paper Digest will return a bulleted summary of the paper. This works only for open access full-text articles that allow derivative generation (i.e. CC-BY equivalent). In case you receive an error message and no summary is generated, it is most likely either the full text is not available to use or the license does not allow derivative generation. Example of journals that work for Paper Digest include but not limited to: [_PLOS One_](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/), [_Wiley_](https://authorservices.wiley.com/open-science/open-access/browse-journals.html), and [_others_](https://www.paper-digest.com/faq#faq4).

Paper Digest works by first extracting the key information from a research paper. This information includes the paper's title, abstract, keywords, and main findings. The platform then uses AI to summarize this information into a concise and easy-to-understand format.

In addition to summarizing research papers, Paper Digest also allows users to track the latest research in their field. The platform provides a news feed of new papers that have been summarized, as well as a list of the most popular papers. Users can also create custom feeds to track specific topics or authors.

Paper Digest is a free platform that is available to anyone. It can be accessed through the website or through the Paper Digest mobile app. The platform is currently available in English, but it is expected to be translated into other languages in the future.

Here are some of the benefits of using Paper Digest:

* **It can help you to find relevant research papers more easily.** Paper Digest uses AI to extract the key information from research papers, so you can quickly scan the summaries to find papers that are relevant to your research.
* **It can help you to understand research papers more easily.** The summaries are written in a concise and easy-to-understand format, so you can get the gist of a paper without having to read the entire thing.
* **It can help you to stay up-to-date on the latest research in your field.** The platform provides a news feed of new papers that have been summarized, as well as a list of the most popular papers.
