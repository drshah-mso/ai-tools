Scholarcy is an online tool that uses artificial intelligence to summarize long research articles, reports, and book chapters into bite-sized sections. This makes it easy for researchers to quickly get the gist of a document without having to read the whole thing.

Scholarcy also allows users to create their own libraries of summary flashcards, which can be shared with others or used for personal reference.
