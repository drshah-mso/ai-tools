### What is ResearchRabbit?

[ResearchRabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/home) is a literature mapping platform that takes one or more relevant seed papers and uses various algorithms to suggest and visualize relevant literature and researchers. The company behind ResearchRabbit had released this platform in beta for a while, and it was fully launched in Aug 2021 for open registration by everyone with an institutional email address.

ResearchRabbit is an AI-powered literature mapping tool that helps researchers find and explore research papers. It uses a variety of techniques to identify relevant papers, including:

* **Citation analysis:** ResearchRabbit looks at the citations of a paper to identify other papers that are related to it.
* **Keyword matching:** ResearchRabbit matches the keywords in a paper to papers that contain those keywords.
* **Semantic analysis:** ResearchRabbit uses natural language processing to understand the meaning of a paper and identify other papers that are similar in meaning.

ResearchRabbit can be used to:

* **Find relevant research:** ResearchRabbit can help you find relevant research papers by matching your research question or the abstract of a paper to its database of over 200 million research papers.
* **Explore research:** ResearchRabbit can help you explore the research literature by providing visualizations of the relationships between different papers.
* **Stay up-to-date on your research field:** ResearchRabbit can help you stay up-to-date on your research field by providing notifications of new papers that match your interests.

ResearchRabbit is a powerful tool for researchers of all levels. It can help you find relevant research papers, explore the research literature, and stay up-to-date on your research field.

Here are some of the features of ResearchRabbit:

* **Research paper search:** ResearchRabbit can help you find relevant research papers by matching your research question or the abstract of a paper to its database of over 200 million research papers.
* **Research paper visualization:** ResearchRabbit can visualize research papers, making it easier to see the relationships between different concepts.
* **Research paper recommendations:** ResearchRabbit can recommend research papers that are related to your interests.
* **Research paper alerts:** ResearchRabbit can send you alerts when new research papers are published that match your interests.
* **Collaborative research:** ResearchRabbit allows users to collaborate on research projects by sharing research papers, notes, and annotations.
* **Research workflow management:** ResearchRabbit helps users manage their research workflow by providing tools for organizing research papers, setting deadlines, and tracking progress.

ResearchRabbit is a free to use tool, but there is also a paid plan that offers additional features, such as:

* **Unlimited research paper search:** The free plan allows you to search for a limited number of research papers per month. The paid plan removes this limit.
* **Advanced research paper visualization:** The paid plan offers more advanced research paper visualization features, such as the ability to create interactive visualizations.
* **Advanced research paper recommendations:** The paid plan offers more advanced research paper recommendations features, such as the ability to recommend papers based on your past research activity.
* **Research paper alerts:** The paid plan allows you to set up alerts for more than one research topic.

### Get Started with One or More Seed Papers

The ResearchRabbit cascade interface is quite intuitive. To get started, a user needs to add some papers as “seeds” on a project. Then, ResearchRabbit will start generating recommendations for “Similar Work”, “Earlier Work”, “Later Work”, and “Suggested Authors” following a chain of papers that cite each other.

For demonstration, six papers to a collection “Open Access” as listed in the first column shown in **Figures 1** and **2**. To continue the literature discovery, we can click on literally any of the papers, recommended works or authors. Then, further details will unfold automatically in the next column(s):
