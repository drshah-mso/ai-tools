Iris.ai is a science research assistant that uses artificial intelligence to help researchers find and understand research papers. It does this by building a "fingerprint" of your research question or the abstract of the paper using machine extracted keywords, contextual synonyms and hypernyms, then matches the fingerprint against more than 100M Open Access papers & patents.

Iris.ai can be used to:

* Find relevant research papers: Iris.ai can help you find relevant research papers by matching your research question or the abstract of a paper to its database of over 100 million open access papers and patents.
* Understand research papers: Iris.ai can help you understand research papers by providing summaries, visualizations, and links to related papers.
* Stay up-to-date on your research field: Iris.ai can help you stay up-to-date on your research field by providing notifications of new papers that match your interests.

Iris.ai is a powerful tool for researchers of all levels. It can help you find relevant research papers, understand them more easily, and stay up-to-date on your research field.

Here are some of the features of Iris.ai:
