## Search ≄ Research

Researchers, Information Experts, Analysts and Intelligence Officers are tasked with finding information and data for reports and findings that move the organization forward. The first stop is always Google, which is a search engine: type in a query - get results - and then good luck...

You’re left to sort through endless results, with nowhere to annotate, share, refine - it’s tens and even hundreds of hours of tedious manual data analysis.

The same goes for academic search engines like Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic: endless data - no way to automatically catalogue and organize it - no inferences - no mapping connections between Co-Authors and research entities - no way to organize the research simply and clearly and get it ready for a powerful report.

It’s time to up your research - it’s time for Socrates!
