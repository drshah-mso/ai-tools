# Obsidian Canvas

Obsidian Canvas is a core plugin that lets you organize notes visually in an infinite space. You can embed your notes and media, create cards and connections, and export your Canvas to various formats. To use Obsidian Canvas to do an article, you can follow these steps:

* Create a new Canvas view by clicking the Canvas icon in the ribbon, or by using the command palette (`Ctrl + P`).
* Drag and drop your notes, images, PDFs, webpages, or other resources from your vault to the Canvas. You can also create new cards by double-clicking or using the toolbar.
* Connect your cards by dragging from one card to another. You can add labels and colors to your connections to indicate the relationships between your cards.
* Arrange your cards in a way that makes sense for your article. You can use the zoom, pan, and align features to adjust the layout of your Canvas.
* Export your Canvas to a markdown file, an image, or a PDF by using the export button in the toolbar. You can also copy your Canvas as text or HTML to paste it elsewhere.
