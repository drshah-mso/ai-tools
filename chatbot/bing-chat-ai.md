Bing Chat is a conversational AI chatbot feature for Bing's search engine. It allows users to interact with an AI chatbot instead of typing search queries. Bing Chat is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 technology, which allows it to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

Bing Chat AI is an AI-powered assistant that can help you browse the web and much more. [You can ask Bing Chat both simple and complex questions; use it for research; request summaries of articles, books, events, the news, sports results, etc.; ask for product comparisons—and that’s just the beginning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/do-more-with-ai/what-is-bing-chat-and-how-can-you-use-it).

Bing Chat AI is based on a new experimental AI that can communicate over Bing search results and provide AI-powered answers directly on the search results page. Each conversation you have in Bing Chat keeps the context of your initial questions. This allows you to clarify past questions and get more information without starting over.

Bing Chat AI is available in Microsoft Edge browser as a feature called Copilot. [You can access Bing Chat by signing into Microsoft Edge and selecting the Bing chat icon in the browser toolbar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/bing-chat). [You can also access Bing Chat from the Microsoft Edge app menu on your mobile device](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/bing-chat).

Bing Chat AI is designed to be your personal assistant for your search. Whether you need to find information, get creative inspiration, or just have some fun, Bing Chat AI is here to help you do more with AI.&#x20;
