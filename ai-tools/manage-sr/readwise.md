[Readwise](https://read.readwise.io/) is a tool to collect information on the web. Using the chrome plugin, you can add anything you find on the web to your Readwise Inbox. This includes Videos, podcasts or emails.

It all lands in an “Inbox” that you can access from your app or any other computer. When you bookmark videos an AI will create a transcript of the video that you can annotate and search it as well.

But what makes Readwise stand out from the crowd is its _Obsidian integration_. It is absolutely top-notch and seamless. As you add and annotate the content, it ends in your Obsidian vault.
