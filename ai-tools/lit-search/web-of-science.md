Web of Science (WoS) is a citation index and abstracting service that indexes scholarly literature from a wide variety of sources, including peer-reviewed journals, books, conference proceedings, and datasets. It is owned and operated by Clarivate Analytics.

WoS is a powerful tool for anyone who needs to find or access scholarly literature. It is a paid service, but it offers a variety of features that are not available on free academic search engines, such as Google Scholar.

### The features of WoS

* **Citation indexing:** WoS indexes the citations of all the articles it covers, so you can see who has cited a particular article and how often.
* **Abstracts:** WoS provides abstracts for all the articles it covers, so you can get a quick overview of an article without having to read the full text.
* **Full-text articles:** WoS offers full-text articles for some of the journals it covers.
* **Author profiles:** WoS provides author profiles, which list the articles an author has published, the citations they have received, and the h-index (a measure of an author's impact).
* **Subject categories:** WoS organizes articles into subject categories, so you can easily find articles on a particular topic.
* **Research trends:** WoS allows you to track research trends, by looking at the number of papers that have been published on a particular topic in recent years.
* **Collaboration networks:** WoS allows you to visualize collaboration networks, by showing how authors have worked together on research projects.

### Advantages of using WoS

* **Accurate:** WoS indexes a large number of scholarly sources, so it is a reliable source of information.
* **Up-to-date:** WoS is updated daily with new citations.
* **Widely used:** WoS is widely used by researchers and students around the world. This means that there is a lot of support and documentation available, as well as a large community of users who can provide help and advice.
* **Features:** WoS offers a variety of features that are not available on free academic search engines, such as Google Scholar. These features include the ability to track citations, create bibliographies, analyze research trends, and visualize collaboration networks.

### New functionality

In response to overwhelming customer requests, we streamlined the research workflow to allow you to export up to 1,000 records at one time or export in RIS format from the Web of Science Core Collection™ for broader re-use in reference managers. Collaboration is also easier than ever, as you can now share search queries with other users.

Moreover, the new interface for the Web of Science is also home to two exciting new visualization tools, including:

* The [Web of Science Author Impact Beamplots](https://clarivate.com/blog/the-web-of-science-author-impact-beamplots-a-new-tool-for-responsible-research-evaluation/), a new visualization tool that showcase the range of a researcher’s publication and citation impact in a single data exhibit. It encourages the responsible use of metrics by using a field-normalized citation metric, not unduly penalizing researchers with gaps in their publication record or disadvantaging those who work in fields with distinctly different publication activity.
* [Enriched Cited References (beta)](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/release-notes/wos/new-wos-april-29-release-notes/), a new visualization tool available for select journals. It helps you to navigate the potentially overwhelming number of cited references by identifying related references (by proximity or co-citation), which references are most impactful within the article and which section of the paper the in-text mention occurred in to infer the reference’s purpose (where available).
