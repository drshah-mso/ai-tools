# Literature Search

Literature search, a crucial aspect of academic research, involves the systematic exploration and retrieval of relevant scholarly information to support a particular topic or inquiry. Researchers employ various tools and databases to conduct comprehensive searches. **Scopus** and **Web of Science** are renowned multidisciplinary databases providing access to a wide array of academic literature ([Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/), [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/)), while **Google Scholar** offers a user-friendly interface for a broad search across disciplines ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)). **Semantic Scholar** employs artificial intelligence to enhance search precision ([Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)), while **PubMed** specializes in biomedical and life sciences ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)). **EvidenceHunt** is a platform facilitating evidence-based research ([EvidenceHunt](https://evidencehunt.com/)), and **Publish or Perish** evaluates research impact using citation metrics. **Zeta Alpha**, **Consensus.app**, and **Elicit** are emerging platforms offering collaborative research and decision-making functionalities. Additionally, **scite.ai** aids researchers in assessing the reliability of scientific claims through citation analysis ([scite.ai](https://scite.ai/)). This diverse array of tools caters to researchers' needs, offering a spectrum of options for efficient literature exploration and retrieval.
