# Publish or Perish

{% embed url="https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish" %}

Publish or Perish is a software program that retrieves and analyzes academic citations. It uses various publicly available [data sources](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish/manual/using/data-sources) to obtain the raw citations, then analyzes these and calculates a series of [citation metrics](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish/manual/using/query-results/metrics). The results are available on-screen and can also be copied to the Windows clipboard (for pasting into other applications) or [saved to a text file](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish/manual/using/query-results/exporting) (for future reference or further analysis).

The development of the Publish or Perish software is a volunteering effort that has been [ongoing since 2006](https://harzing.com/blog/2016/10/publish-or-perish-version-5). Publish or Perish was designed to help individual academics to present their [case for research impact](https://harzing.com/blog/2016/07/how-to-make-your-case-for-impact) and [tenure and promotion ](https://harzing.com/blog/2016/11/presenting-your-case-for-tenure-or-promotion)to its best advantage, [even if you have very few citations](https://harzing.com/blog/2017/11/making-your-case-for-impact-if-you-have-few-citations). You can also use it to decide [which journals to submit to](https://harzing.com/blog/2016/12/where-to-submit-your-paper-which-journals-publish-on-your-topic), to prepare for a [job interview](https://harzing.com/blog/2017/01/want-to-impress-at-an-academic-job-interview), to do a [literature review](https://harzing.com/blog/2017/02/using-publish-or-perish-to-do-a-literature-review), to [do bibliometric research](https://harzing.com/blog/2017/08/running-the-ref-on-a-rainy-sunday-afternoon), to [write laudatios or obituaries](https://harzing.com/blog/2019/06/writing-laudations-or-obituaries), or to do some homework before [meeting your academic hero](https://harzing.com/blog/2016/09/meeting-an-official-guest-or-your-academic-hero). Publish or Perish is [a real Swiss army knife](https://harzing.com/blog/2017/01/publish-or-perish-general-search-a-swiss-army-knife).
