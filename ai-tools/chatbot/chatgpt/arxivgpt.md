### How does ArxivGPT work?

ArxivGPT utilizes the power of [ChatGPT](https://ambcrypto.com/blog/what-does-gpt-stand-for-in-chat-gpt-everything-you-need-to-know/), an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. This model is trained on a diverse range of internet text, enabling it to generate human-like text based on the prompts given.&#x20;

When the user requests a summary of a paper, the extension sends the paper’s abstract to the model, which then generates a concise and informative summary.
