Bing Chat is a conversational AI chatbot feature for Bing's search engine. It allows users to interact with an AI chatbot instead of typing search queries. Bing Chat is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 technology, which allows it to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.\

With the new Bing built into the Microsoft Edge sidebar, you can ask complex questions, find comprehensive answers, get summarized information, find inspiration to build upon all in a side-by-side view, with no need to flip between tabs.
