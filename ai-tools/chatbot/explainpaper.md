Explainpaper is an AI-powered tool designed to help readers better understand academic papers. It allows readers to upload a paper and then highlight any confusing text they come across.

Explainpaper then provides an explanation of the highlighted text, helping readers to better comprehend the paper. By using its AI-based algorithms, Explainpaper can identify complex ideas and provide simple explanations.

It also offers readers the chance to try out the tool on the paper that started it all – Attention Is All You Need – which introduces a new type of network architecture called the Transformer, which is based solely on attention mechanisms.

Explainpaper makes it easier for readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the paper’s content.
