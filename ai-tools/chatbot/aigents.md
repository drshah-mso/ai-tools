## How does Aigents work? <a href="#h-how-does-aigents-work" id="h-how-does-aigents-work"></a>

Once a computer science professional signs up for the service, Aigents [acts as a platform](https://aigents.co/learn/how-it-works) to find free learning resources for data scientists, ML engineers, and python developers. The internet is full of learning resources, including paid courses, tutorials, and blogs covering a vast amount of knowledge, but they are often placed behind ads or sign up barriers.

Aigents does the heavy lifting by looking for resources that are completely free or without ads or the need to register. “That’s because these resources are made by true coding and data fanatics who love what they do and who enjoy sharing their knowledge,” the platform notes on its website. Here are some of the key ways Aigents helps its users:

* **Handpicked learning resources:** This is the most interesting way Aigents helps its users. It is difficult to find useful resources by scouring the internet and Aigents does this by collecting thousands of these resources under the “open access” learning resources. This includes “blog articles, tutorials, official user guides and even complete books which are available for free.” You might wonder how it is different from the larger internet. Well, Aigents has not only collected all the resources but has also built a database of those resources. Now, to further simplify the process, Aigents has also built a search engine. This whole process makes it an extremely useful source for getting the news and skilling further.
* **Discovery:** When it comes to this discovery engine, all one needs to do is enter the keyword related to what you want to learn and it will provide the most relevant results, that are free and open-source. The users will get all the official tutorials from Python and many related frameworks, thousands of handpicked blogs and tutorials, and over 50 books from renowned authors.
