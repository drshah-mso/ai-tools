Paper discovery is the process of finding relevant academic papers on a particular topic. This can be a daunting task, as there are millions of papers published every year. AI tools can help to make paper discovery more efficient and effective.

Popular AI tools for paper discovery include Connected Papers, R Discovery, Humata AI, Litmaps, ResearchRabbit and Inciteful.
