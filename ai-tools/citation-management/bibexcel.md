# Bibexcel

{% embed url="https://homepage.univie.ac.at/juan.gorraiz/bibexcel/" %}

Bibexcel is a great tool for helping with bibliometric analysis, and citation studies in particular. It was developed by one of bibliometric’s leading experts, Olle Persson. Despite his retirement, the software is still available from the web at: [http://homepage.univie.ac.at/juan.gorraiz/bibexcel/](http://homepage.univie.ac.at/juan.gorraiz/bibexcel/) and remains one of the most widely used tools given its flexibility and speed. Installation is easy, just copy the files to a directory on your hard drive and be sure to put the help files in the same directory. Read the web page for more help if this doesn’t work as there are some exceptions.&#x20;

### Using Bibexcel for Citation Analysis&#x20;

The first step is to get some source data to analyse. In citaion analysis, this invariably means finding a selection of source articles from the Social Science Citation Index/Science Citation Index. These are commercial databases and are part of the Web of Science or ISI data services to which your university probably subscribes.&#x20;

### Using Social Science/Science Citations Index&#x20;

Identify your source articles using the WoS/ISI search functions as you would in the normal way. It is important to understand what your study is about before you rush into downloading data. I’ve undertaken a few studies based on the contents of one journal and so my source is easy to identify. More elaborate projects may at the citations of one author or university department. Whatever your plans, if you get the data from the Science/Social Science Citations Index, then you need to follow the same steps in downloading and preparing the data.
