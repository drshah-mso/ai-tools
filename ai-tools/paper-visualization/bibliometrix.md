{% embed url="https://www.bibliometrix.org/home/" %}

Bibliometric is a term used to describe the quantitative study of the publication, dissemination, and use of scientific literature. It is a branch of scientometrics, which is the study of the quantitative aspects of science and technology.

Bibliometrix package provides various routines for importing bibliographic data from [SCOPUS](https://www.scopus.com/), [Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science](http://www.webofknowledge.com/), [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), [Digital Science Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/) and [Cochrane databases](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/), performing bibliometric analysis and building data matrices for co-citation, coupling, scientific collaboration analysis and co-word analysis.

_bibliometrix_ is a unique tool, developed in the statistical computing and graphic R language, according to a logical bibliometric workflow. R is highly extensible because it is an object-oriented and functional programming language, and therefore is pretty easy to automate analyses and create new functions. As it has an open-software nature, it is also easy to get help from the usersâ€™ community, mainly composed by prominent statisticians. Therefore, bibliometrix is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and can be integrated with other statistical R-packages. That why, it is useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.

Bibliometrics can be used to:

* **Measure the impact of research:** Bibliometric can be used to measure the impact of research by looking at the number of citations a research paper has received.
* **Identify emerging trends:** Bibliometric can be used to identify emerging trends by looking at the number of papers that have been published on a particular topic in recent years.
* **Map the landscape of a research field:** Bibliometric can be used to map the landscape of a research field by looking at the relationships between different research papers, authors, and institutions.
* **Identify key players:** Bibliometric can be used to identify key players in a research field by looking at the number of papers they have published, the number of citations they have received, and the number of collaborations they have formed.

There are a variety of tools that can be used for bibliometric analysis, such as VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Gephi.

Here are some of the advantages of using bibliometric analysis:

* **Quantitative:** Bibliometric analysis is a quantitative approach to studying research. This means that it is based on data and statistics, which can be used to make objective and informed decisions.
* **Widely used:** Bibliometric analysis is a widely used tool in the research community. This means that there is a lot of support and documentation available, as well as a large community of users who can provide help and advice.
* **Flexible:** Bibliometric analysis is a flexible tool that can be used to study a variety of research topics. This means that it can be used to answer a variety of research questions.

Here are some of the disadvantages of using bibliometric analysis:

* **Can be time-consuming:** Bibliometric analysis can be time-consuming, especially if you are working with a large dataset.
* **Requires technical skills:** Bibliometric analysis requires some technical skills to use.
* **Not always accurate:** Bibliometric analysis is not always accurate, as it is based on data that is collected from the scientific literature. This data can be inaccurate or incomplete.
