# Paper Visualization

Paper visualization is the process of representing the relationships between different papers in a visual way. This can be helpful for understanding the research landscape, identifying gaps in the literature, and finding new papers that are relevant to a research topic.

Popular AI tools for paper visualization include Inciteful, ResearchRabbit, Open Knowledge Maps (OKM), and SciSpace. These tools use machine learning to create visualizations of the relationships between different papers. They can be used to identify gaps in the literature, to find new papers that are relevant to a research topic, and to understand the research landscape.

The use of AI tools for paper visualization can offer several benefits, including clarity, collaboration, and innovation. Paper visualization can help to make the research landscape more clear and understandable, which can be helpful for researchers who are new to a field or who are trying to understand a complex research question. It can also be a valuable tool for collaboration, as it allows researchers to share their knowledge and insights with each other. Additionally, paper visualization can help researchers to identify new research opportunities by visualizing the research landscape and seeing where there are gaps in the literature.
