# Open Knowledge Maps (OKM)

Open Knowledge Maps (OKM) is an open-source platform for creating and visualizing knowledge graphs. It is based on the RDF (Resource Description Framework) standard, which makes it possible to integrate data from different sources. OKM can be used to create knowledge graphs for a variety of purposes, such as:

* **Research:** OKM can be used to create knowledge graphs of scientific research papers. This can help researchers to find and explore related research, identify gaps in the literature, and build new theories.
* **Business:** OKM can be used to create knowledge graphs of business data. This can help businesses to make better decisions, improve their products and services, and identify new opportunities.
* **Education:** OKM can be used to create knowledge graphs of educational content. This can help students to learn more effectively and efficiently, and teachers to create more engaging and interactive lessons.

Here are some of the features of OKM:

* **Data integration:** OKM can be used to integrate data from different sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, and APIs. This makes it possible to create knowledge graphs that are more comprehensive and accurate.
* **Knowledge graph visualization:** OKM can be used to visualize knowledge graphs in a variety of ways, such as graphs, maps, and timelines. This makes it easier to understand the relationships between different concepts.
* **Knowledge graph exploration:** OKM can be used to explore knowledge graphs by following links between different concepts. This makes it possible to discover new information and insights.
* **Knowledge graph sharing:** OKM can be used to share knowledge graphs with others. This makes it possible to collaborate on research projects and to learn from each other.
