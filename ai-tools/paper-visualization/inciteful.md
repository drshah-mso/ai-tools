# Inciteful

## Introduction

The goal of Inciteful is to give the world free tools to help accelerate academic research. If that means getting up to speed on a new topic, finding the latest literature, or figuring out how two ideas are connected, we can help.

Unlike a traditional search engine, citations are the cornerstone of all of our tools. Building these tools for all academic literature has only recently been possible with the rise of open scholarly bibliographic data and the amazing work being done by the these groups.

To date we have two tools. Paper Discovery and the Literature Connector. More tools are actively under development.

The Paper Discovery tool builds a network of papers from citations, uses network analysis algorithms to analyze the network, and gives you the information you need to quickly get up to speed on that topic. You can find the most similar papers, important papers as well as prolific authors and institutions.

Our second tool was the Literature Connector. Intended for interdisciplinary scholars trying to bridge two domains, it allows you to enter two papers and it will give you an interactive visualization showing you how they are connected by the literature. From there you can send the papers you find into our Paper Discovery tool to find other relevant literature which happened to not be the "shortest path" between the two papers.

Inciteful is under active development and our hope is that, over time, our tools will build upon each other giving you an unrivaled experience for quickly discovering new literature.

Being built off the backs of free and open data, we commit to paying it forward by keeping our own tools free for everyone. To learn more, head over to our about page.
