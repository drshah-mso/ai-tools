## Introduction

Elicit is an AI-powered tool that assists researchers in searching for relevant research papers. It uses advanced algorithms to analyse and understand the content of papers, making it easier to find specific information. Elicit uses language models to help you automate research workflows, like parts of literature review.

Elicit can find relevant papers without perfect keyword match, summarize takeaways from the paper specific to your question, and extract key information from the papers.

While answering questions with research is the main focus of Elicit, there are also other research tasks that help with brainstorming, summarization, and text classification.
