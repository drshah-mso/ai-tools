## Introduction

Scite.ai is a free AI-powered platform that helps researchers evaluate the credibility of research papers. It does this by analyzing the citations of a paper and comparing them to other papers in the same field. This allows researchers to see how a paper has been received by the scientific community and to identify potential problems with the paper's methodology or conclusions.

Here are some of the features of Scite.ai:

* **Smart Citations:** Scite.ai provides "Smart Citations" for each paper. These citations include the context of the citation, as well as a classification describing whether the paper provides supporting or contrasting evidence for the cited claim.
* **Citation Network:** Scite.ai provides a citation network for each paper. This network shows how the paper has been cited by other papers, and it can be used to identify potential problems with the paper's methodology or conclusions.
* **Credibility Score:** Scite.ai assigns a credibility score to each paper. This score is based on the paper's citations, as well as other factors such as the author's reputation and the journal in which the paper was published.
