## Introduction

Scite.ai is a free AI-powered platform that helps researchers evaluate the credibility of research papers. It does this by analyzing the citations of a paper and comparing them to other papers in the same field. This allows researchers to see how a paper has been received by the scientific community and to identify potential problems with the paper's methodology or conclusions.

Scite.ai was founded in 2018 by a team of researchers from the University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute. The platform is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for researchers who want to ensure that they are reading and citing reliable research.

Here are some of the features of Scite.ai:

* **Smart Citations:** Scite.ai provides "Smart Citations" for each paper. These citations include the context of the citation, as well as a classification describing whether the paper provides supporting or contrasting evidence for the cited claim.
* **Citation Network:** Scite.ai provides a citation network for each paper. This network shows how the paper has been cited by other papers, and it can be used to identify potential problems with the paper's methodology or conclusions.
* **Credibility Score:** Scite.ai assigns a credibility score to each paper. This score is based on the paper's citations, as well as other factors such as the author's reputation and the journal in which the paper was published.

Scite.ai is a valuable tool for researchers who want to ensure that they are reading and citing reliable research. It is still under development, but it has the potential to be a powerful tool for evaluating the credibility of research papers.

Here are some additional details about Scite.ai:

* It is available as a web app and as a Chrome extension.
* It covers a wide range of disciplines, including computer science, biology, medicine, and economics.
* It is used by researchers at over 1,000 universities and research institutions around the world.
