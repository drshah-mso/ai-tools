## Introduction

Semantic Scholar is a free web platform that provides a comprehensive overview of research literature. It allows users to search for papers, read summaries of papers, and explore the connections between different papers. It also provides tools for evaluating the credibility of papers and for tracking the latest research in a particular field.

Semantic Scholar is a valuable tool for researchers, students, and anyone who is interested in learning more about the latest research.

Here are some of the benefits of using Semantic Scholar:

* **It can help you to find relevant research papers more easily.** Semantic Scholar uses a combination of machine learning and natural language processing to extract information from research papers. This allows you to quickly scan the summaries to find papers that are relevant to your research.
* **It can help you to understand research papers more easily.** The summaries are written in a concise and easy-to-understand format, so you can get the gist of a paper without having to read the entire thing.
* **It can help you to stay up-to-date on the latest research in your field.** Semantic Scholar provides a news feed of new papers that have been summarized, as well as a list of the most popular papers.
* **It can help you to evaluate the credibility of research papers.** Semantic Scholar provides tools for evaluating the credibility of papers, such as citation analysis and author reputation.
* **It can help you to explore the connections between different papers.** Semantic Scholar provides a citation network that shows how papers are connected to each other. This can help you to identify gaps in the literature and to find new research opportunities.

Here are some additional details about Semantic Scholar:

* It was founded in 2015 by researchers from Stanford University and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
* It uses a combination of machine learning and natural language processing to extract information from research papers.
* It provides a comprehensive overview of research literature, including citations, abstracts, and full text.
* It allows users to explore the connections between different papers, identify gaps in the literature, and track the latest research in a particular field.
* It is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for researchers who want to find, understand, and share research papers more easily.
