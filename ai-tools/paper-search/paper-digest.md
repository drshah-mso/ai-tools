## Introduction

Paper Digest is a platform that uses AI to automatically summarize research papers. It was founded in 2018 by a team of researchers and engineers from New York University. The platform is designed to help researchers find, understand, and share research papers more easily.

Paper Digest works by first extracting the key information from a research paper. This information includes the paper's title, abstract, keywords, and main findings. The platform then uses AI to summarize this information into a concise and easy-to-understand format.

In addition to summarizing research papers, Paper Digest also allows users to track the latest research in their field. The platform provides a news feed of new papers that have been summarized, as well as a list of the most popular papers. Users can also create custom feeds to track specific topics or authors.

Paper Digest is a free platform that is available to anyone. It can be accessed through the website or through the Paper Digest mobile app. The platform is currently available in English, but it is expected to be translated into other languages in the future.

Here are some of the benefits of using Paper Digest:
