## Advanced Searching

Advanced search techniques that you can use with EvidenceHunt:

* **Boolean search:** Boolean search is a way to combine search terms using logical operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT. For example, the search query "(pain AND headache) OR fever" would return studies that mention either pain and headache, or fever.
* **Phrase searching:** Phrase searching allows you to search for a specific phrase, such as "treatment for migraine." This will ensure that the search results only include studies that mention the phrase "treatment for migraine" in that order.
* **Wildcard searching:** Wildcard searching allows you to use a wildcard character, such as \_, to represent any number of characters. For example, the search query "head\_ache" would return studies that mention headache, headaches, or headache pain.

Tips for using advanced search techniques:

* [x] Use parentheses to group search terms together. This will help to ensure that the search terms are interpreted correctly.
* [x] Use the **Advanced Search** tab to perform more complex searches.

## Clinical Decision-Making

Tips on how to use EvidenceHunt for clinical decision-making:

1. **Start by identifying the clinical question.** What do you need to know in order to make a decision about patient care?
2. **Use EvidenceHunt to search for relevant studies.** Use the search bar to enter your clinical question, or use the advanced search features to narrow down your results.
3. **Critically evaluate the evidence.** Not all studies are created equal. When you find a study that is relevant to your clinical question, take the time to critically evaluate the evidence. This includes considering the study design, the methodology, the results, and the limitations of the study.
4. **Integrate the evidence with your clinical expertise.** The evidence from studies is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to making clinical decisions. You also need to consider your clinical expertise, the patient's preferences, and the patient's values.
5. **Communicate the evidence to the patient.** Once you have made a decision, it is important to communicate the evidence to the patient. This will help the patient to understand the rationale for your decision and to make informed choices about their care.

## Case Study

### Case Study 1

How EvidenceHunt can be used to make informed decisions about patient care

**Clinical Question:**

A 65-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents to your clinic with a complaint of chest pain. She describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing pain that is located in the center of her chest. The pain is worse when she exerts herself and is relieved with rest.

You suspect that the patient may be having a heart attack. You want to find the best evidence on the most effective treatment for heart attacks.

**EvidenceHunt Search:**

You go to the EvidenceHunt website and search for "treatment for heart attack." You use the advanced search features to narrow down your results to studies that were published in the last 5 years and that were conducted in a high-quality setting.

**Critical Evaluation of Evidence:**

You find a study that was published in the **New England Journal of Medicine** in 2022. The study was a randomized controlled trial that compared the effectiveness of two different treatments for heart attacks. The study found that the treatment that included aspirin and clopidogrel was more effective at preventing death and heart attack than the treatment that included only aspirin.

**Integration of Evidence with Clinical Expertise:**

You consider the evidence from the study, but you also consider your clinical expertise. You know that the patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes, which are both risk factors for heart attack. You also know that the patient is taking aspirin, which is a blood thinner that can help to prevent heart attack.

**Decision:**

Based on the evidence and your clinical expertise, you decide to start the patient on clopidogrel in addition to aspirin. You explain the rationale for your decision to the patient and you answer any questions that she may have.

**Communication of Evidence to the Patient:**

You give the patient a copy of the study that you found on EvidenceHunt. You also explain the limitations of the study and you encourage the patient to ask questions if she has any.

**Outcome:**

The patient is started on clopidogrel and she does not have another heart attack. She is able to continue her normal activities and she is satisfied with her care.

### Case Study 2

How EvidenceHunt can help a computer science researcher doing research in thyroid disease

**Research Question**

A computer science researcher is interested in developing a new machine learning algorithm to predict the risk of thyroid disease. The researcher wants to find the best evidence on the clinical features that are associated with thyroid disease.

**EvidenceHunt Search**

The researcher goes to the EvidenceHunt website and searches for "clinical features of thyroid disease." The researcher uses the advanced search features to narrow down their results to studies that were published in the last 5 years and that were conducted in a high-quality setting.

**Critical Evaluation of Evidence**

The researcher finds a study that was published in the **Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism** in 2022. The study was a systematic review that identified the clinical features that are most strongly associated with thyroid disease. The study found that the following clinical features were most strongly associated with thyroid disease:

* Age
* Gender
* Family history
* Race/ethnicity
* Symptoms
* Physical exam findings
* Laboratory tests

**Integration of Evidence with Clinical Expertise**

The researcher considers the evidence from the study, but they also consider their clinical expertise. The researcher knows that there are a number of other factors that can contribute to the development of thyroid disease, such as environmental factors and lifestyle factors.

**Decision**

Based on the evidence and their clinical expertise, the researcher decides to use the clinical features identified in the study as the basis for their machine learning algorithm. The researcher also plans to collect additional data on environmental and lifestyle factors to improve the accuracy of their algorithm.

**Outcome**

The researcher develops a machine learning algorithm that is able to predict the risk of thyroid disease with 80% accuracy. The researcher publishes their findings in a peer-reviewed journal and the algorithm is made available to the public.
