# Consensus.app

{% embed url="https://consensus.app/" %}

## Introduction

Consensus.app was founded in 2021 by a team of researchers from Stanford University and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Consensus.app works by first extracting the key information from research papers. This information includes the paper's title, abstract, keywords, and main findings. The platform then uses AI to summarize this information into a concise and easy-to-understand format.

In addition to summarizing research papers, Consensus.app also allows users to track the latest research in their field. The platform provides a news feed of new papers that have been summarized, as well as a list of the most popular papers. Users can also create custom feeds to track specific topics or authors.

Consensus.app is a free platform that is available to anyone. It can be accessed through the website or through the Consensus.app mobile app. The platform is currently available in English, but it is expected to be translated into other languages in the future.

Here are some of the benefits of using Consensus.app:

* **It can help you to find relevant research papers more easily.** Consensus.app uses AI to extract the key information from research papers, so you can quickly scan the summaries to find papers that are relevant to your research.
* **It can help you to understand research papers more easily.** The summaries are written in a concise and easy-to-understand format, so you can get the gist of a paper without having to read the entire thing.
* **It can help you to stay up-to-date on the latest research in your field.** The platform provides a news feed of new papers that have been summarized, as well as a list of the most popular papers.

If you are a researcher or student, I encourage you to check out Consensus.app. It is a free platform that can help you to find, understand, and share research papers more easily.

Here are some additional details about Consensus.app:

* It is based on the Semantic Scholar dataset, which contains over 200 million research papers.
* It uses a variety of AI techniques, including natural language processing, machine learning, and information retrieval.
* It is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for researchers who want to find and understand research papers more easily.
