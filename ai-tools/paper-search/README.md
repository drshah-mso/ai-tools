# Paper Search

Paper search is the process of finding relevant academic papers on a particular topic. This can be a daunting task, as there are millions of papers published every year. AI tools can help to make paper search more efficient and effective.

Popular AI tools for paper search include Elicit, EvidenceHunt, Litmaps, Semantic Scholar, Consensus.app, Paper Digest, and SciTe AI. These tools use natural language processing, machine learning, and other AI techniques to identify and rank the most relevant papers for a given query. They can also provide summaries of the papers, making it easier to quickly assess their relevance.

The use of AI tools for paper search can offer several benefits, including accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness. AI tools can be more accurate than traditional paper search methods, as they can understand the meaning of search queries and identify papers that are likely to be relevant. They can also save researchers time by automating the paper search process. Additionally, AI tools can help researchers to find papers that they would not have found otherwise.
